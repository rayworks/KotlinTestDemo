# Kotlin JUnit tests demo
Demo project for my blog post [Using Kotlin For Tests in Android](https://medium.com/@sergii/using-kotlin-for-tests-in-android-6d4a0c818776#.lgj4ztprx) @ Medium.

This project shows how to use Kotlin only in your Android test dependencies and test code. In this way we don't have any overhead in production sources and application method count & APK size.
